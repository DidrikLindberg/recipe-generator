## Description

Savvy Chef is a web application that helps you find recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. With its intuitive interface, you can easily search for ingredients and add them to your list. The app then uses a Spoonacular API to suggest recipes that match your ingredient list. You can also filter the recipe results based on food intolerances, dietary restrictions, price sorting, and cuisines. Savvy chef also uses the CocktailDB API to generate delicious and unique cocktails. Savvy Chef eliminates the hassle of meal planning and helps you cook delicious meals with the ingredients you already have in your kitchen.

This app was created to address the common problem faced by users who struggle to come up with meal ideas or recipes based on the ingredients they have available at home. By providing inspiration and direct recipes tailored to individual ingredients and dietary preferences, and other criteria, the app aims to make cooking easier and more accessible for its users.There are a ton of great recipe sites that offer all kinds of filters. There are also recipe sites built around ingredient lists you feed them. But our site combines the vast filtering options with the ability to filter even further with ingredients you want to include. You can also quickly pair a cocktail with your meal.

## Code Highlight

I wanted to highlight this code snippet because this code is by far the most complex api search any of us have done. sets an event listener for the button with ID "get-recipes". When the button is clicked, it makes an asynchronous API call to the Spoonacular complexSearch endpoint, using the parameters created in the preceding lines of code. The API URL is constructed by concatenating the various parameters together. One cool thing about this code is the use of template literals to create the URL string in a more readable and efficient way. Another cool thing is the use of the ternary operator to add optional parameters to the URL only if they are present.

```JavaScript
 var getRecipesButton = document.getElementById("get-recipes");
  getRecipesButton.addEventListener("click", async function () {
    resultsContainer.style.display = "";
    cocktailButton.classList.add("is-4");

    var selectedIngredients = selectedItems.join();

    var spoonacularApiKey = "2e39a525784f4df6bc533d1a0e3e2403";

    var intolerancesParam =
      intolerances.length > 0 ? "&intolerances=" + intolerances.join(",") : "";

    var dietsParam = selectedDiet ? "&diet=" + selectedDiet : "";

    var maxReadyTimeParam =
      selectedMaxReadyTimes.length > 0
        ? "&maxReadyTime=" + Math.min(...selectedMaxReadyTimes)
        : "";

    var cuisineParam = selectedCuisine ? "&cuisine=" + selectedCuisine : "";

    // Constructed the full API URL for the Spoonacular complexSearch endpoint
    var apiURLspoonacular =
      "https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?includeIngredients=" +
      selectedIngredients +
      "&number=10&addRecipeInformation=true" +
      intolerancesParam +
      maxReadyTimeParam +
      dietsParam +
      cuisineParam +
      "&apiKey=" +
      spoonacularApiKey;
```
